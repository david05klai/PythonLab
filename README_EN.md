### Description
**PythonLab** is a learning-focused Python project that explores basic programming logic through small interactive games and exercises.  
It includes projects such as **Number Guessing** and **Word Guessing**, demonstrating the use of functions, conditionals, loops, and user input.

The main goal of this project is to practice Python fundamentals and understand how to structure small applications into multiple modules.
